# SpecKit Constitution
Project management and specification framework emphasizing quality, testing, and user-centric development

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality First
Every line of code MUST meet strict quality standards before integration. Code quality includes:
readability with clear variable/function names and comprehensive comments; adherence to
established style guides and linting rules; maintainability through modular design and
clear separation of concerns; security through input validation and secure coding practices.

**Rationale**: Quality code reduces technical debt, minimizes bugs, and ensures long-term
maintainability. Poor code quality compounds over time, making features harder to implement
and maintain.

### II. Test-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
TDD is mandatory for all feature development. Tests MUST be written first, approved by stakeholders,
confirmed to fail, then implementation begins. The Red-Green-Refactor cycle is strictly enforced:
Red (write failing test), Green (implement minimal code to pass), Refactor (improve without breaking tests).
All tests MUST be independently executable and provide clear feedback on failures.

**Rationale**: TDD ensures requirements are clearly understood before implementation, provides
immediate feedback on code changes, and creates a safety net for refactoring. It also serves
as living documentation of system behavior.

### III. User Experience Consistency
All user-facing elements MUST provide consistent, intuitive experiences. This includes:
uniform interface patterns across all components; consistent terminology and language;
predictable behavior and navigation flows; accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA minimum);
responsive design that works across devices and screen sizes.

**Rationale**: Consistent UX reduces cognitive load, improves user adoption, and minimizes
support requests. Inconsistent experiences frustrate users and damage product credibility.

### IV. Performance Standards
All features MUST meet defined performance benchmarks before deployment. Performance requirements
include: API response times under 200ms for 95th percentile; UI interactions responsive within
100ms; page load times under 3 seconds on 3G connections; memory usage optimization to prevent
leaks; database queries optimized with proper indexing.

**Rationale**: Performance directly impacts user satisfaction and business outcomes. Slow
applications lose users and create competitive disadvantages.

### V. Observability & Maintainability
All systems MUST be designed for monitoring, debugging, and maintenance. This includes:
structured logging with appropriate detail levels; metrics and monitoring for key business
and technical indicators; error tracking and alerting systems; clear documentation for
troubleshooting; deployment and rollback procedures.

**Rationale**: Observable systems enable quick problem resolution, proactive issue detection,
and data-driven decision making. Poor observability leads to difficult debugging and
unpredictable system behavior.

## Quality Assurance Standards

All code changes MUST pass comprehensive quality gates including automated testing suites
(unit, integration, and contract tests); code review by at least one qualified team member;
static analysis tools for security vulnerabilities and code quality; performance testing
for user-facing features; accessibility testing for UI components.

Documentation requirements include API contracts with request/response examples; user guides
for new features; architectural decision records for significant design choices; runbooks
for operational procedures; inline code comments explaining complex business logic.

## Development Workflow & Review Process

Feature development follows strict workflow stages: specification approval before implementation;
constitution compliance verification during planning; iterative development with regular
testing; peer review with quality checklist validation; staging deployment with user
acceptance testing; production deployment with monitoring verification.

Code review requirements include functionality verification against specifications; adherence
to coding standards and principles; security vulnerability assessment; performance impact
evaluation; test coverage and quality verification; documentation completeness check.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and guidelines. All pull requests,
code reviews, and feature implementations MUST verify compliance with these principles.
Complexity that violates principles MUST be explicitly justified with business rationale
and simpler alternatives documented.

Amendment procedure requires written proposal with rationale; team review and discussion
period of minimum 5 business days; unanimous approval from core team members; migration
plan for existing code if applicable; version increment following semantic versioning.

Non-compliance handling includes immediate feedback during code review; documentation of
violations and remediation plans; escalation to project leadership for repeated violations;
potential blocking of releases until compliance achieved.
