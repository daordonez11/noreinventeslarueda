# Feature Specification: No Reinventes la Rueda - Tech Library Webapp

**Feature Branch**: `001-tech-library-webapp`  
**Created**: 2025-10-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create no reinventes la rueda, a webapp and landing page that will show you the most used libraries and up to date technologies that you should use when vibe coding projects, this page will be done in spanish and should be optimized for SEO indexing"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-27

- Q: How should the system maintain and update the technology recommendations? → A: Hybrid approach combining automated scraping of GitHub repositories (based on stars/metrics) with weighted community voting to influence rankings
- Q: How should the system handle libraries that become deprecated, abandoned, or have no recent maintenance? → A: Mark deprecated libraries with warning badges and move to bottom of category. Libraries remain visible and accessible but clearly flagged for user awareness
- Q: Which public sources should the system scrape/integrate to gather library metadata and popularity metrics? → A: GitHub API only for initial launch. Single source reduces complexity. Plan for future expansion to npm, PyPI, Maven Central, and other package registries
- Q: How should the system prevent spam and ensure voting/submission quality? → A: Authenticated voting via GitHub/Google OAuth login required. Vote history tracked per user to detect patterns and prevent manipulation
- Q: What key metrics should the system track to measure success and user engagement? → A: Full analytics including page views, search queries, library clicks, voting patterns, geographic distribution, search-to-click conversion rates, popular categories, and voting trends over time

### User Story 1 - Browse Technology Recommendations (Priority: P1)

A Spanish-speaking developer visits the site to discover popular libraries and technologies for their next project. They can browse different technology categories (frontend, backend, databases, etc.) and see current recommendations with brief descriptions and usage statistics.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - providing curated technology recommendations. Without this, the site has no purpose.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by visiting the homepage and navigating through technology categories, delivering immediate value for developers seeking technology guidance.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer visits the homepage, **When** they view the technology categories, **Then** they see organized sections for different tech stacks (frontend, backend, databases, etc.)
2. **Given** a developer clicks on a category, **When** the category page loads, **Then** they see a list of recommended libraries with names, descriptions, and popularity indicators
3. **Given** a developer views library recommendations, **When** they read the descriptions, **Then** all content is displayed in Spanish with clear, non-technical language

---

### User Story 2 - Search for Specific Technologies (Priority: P2)

A developer knows what type of solution they need and wants to quickly find relevant recommendations. They can search by technology name, category, or use case to find specific libraries and frameworks.

**Why this priority**: Search functionality greatly improves user experience and allows faster discovery of relevant technologies.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by using the search functionality to find specific technologies and verify results are relevant and comprehensive.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer is on any page, **When** they type in the search box, **Then** they see real-time suggestions and search results
2. **Given** a developer searches for a technology type, **When** results appear, **Then** they see relevant libraries ranked by popularity and currency
3. **Given** a developer finds a library through search, **When** they click on it, **Then** they see detailed information about the library

---

### User Story 3 - Access Detailed Library Information (Priority: P3)

A developer wants comprehensive information about a specific library to make an informed decision. They can view detailed pages with documentation links, GitHub stats, community activity, and usage examples.

**Why this priority**: Detailed information helps developers make confident technology choices, increasing the site's authority and usefulness.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by accessing individual library detail pages and verifying all information is accurate and helpful for decision-making.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer clicks on a library, **When** the detail page loads, **Then** they see comprehensive information including description, GitHub stats, documentation links, and community activity
2. **Given** a developer views library details, **When** they scroll through the page, **Then** they find practical usage examples and integration guides
3. **Given** a developer wants to use a library, **When** they view installation instructions, **Then** they see clear, copy-pasteable commands and setup steps

---

### User Story 4 - Vote on Library Recommendations (Priority: P3)

A developer wants to influence the quality of recommendations by voting on libraries they find useful or outdated. They can upvote/downvote libraries to help surface the best options and bury poor recommendations.

**Why this priority**: Community voting improves ranking quality over time and increases user engagement with the platform.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by authenticating, voting on libraries, and verifying votes contribute to ranking changes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer is logged in via GitHub/Google OAuth, **When** they view a library, **Then** they see vote buttons (upvote/downvote) next to the library
2. **Given** a developer clicks to vote, **When** their vote is recorded, **Then** their voting history is tracked and the library ranking updates to reflect their contribution
3. **Given** a developer is not logged in, **When** they visit the site, **Then** they see vote counts but cannot cast votes until authenticated

### Edge Cases

- **Deprecated or Unmaintained Libraries**: Libraries with no recent activity are marked with a "Deprecated" or "Unmaintained" warning badge and moved to the bottom of their category to deprioritize them. Users can still access detailed information but are warned of maintenance status.
- How does the system handle libraries with no recent activity or maintenance?
- What occurs when search yields no relevant results?
- How does the site perform when accessed from different Spanish-speaking regions with varying internet speeds?
